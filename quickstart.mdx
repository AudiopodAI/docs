<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Python">```bash pip install audiopod ```</Tab>
  <Tab title="Node.js">```bash npm install audiopod-sdk ```</Tab>
  <Tab title="cURL">No installation required - use cURL directly</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 4: Make Your First API Call

Let's create your first AI-generated speech:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Python">
    ```python
    import os
    import requests

    # Generate speech using Text to Speech API
    response = requests.post(
        "https://api.audiopod.ai/api/v1/voice/voices/aura/generate",
        headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {os.getenv('AUDIOPOD_API_KEY')}"},
        data={
            "input_text": "Hello world! This is my first AudioPod AI generated voice.",
            "audio_format": "mp3",
            "speed": 1.0
        }
    )

    if response.status_code == 200:
        job_data = response.json()
        job_id = job_data["id"]
        print(f"Voice generation job created: {job_id}")
        print("Check job status to download audio when ready")
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Node.js">
    ```javascript
    const fetch = require('node-fetch');

    // Generate speech using Text to Speech API
    const formData = new FormData();
    formData.append('input_text', 'Hello world! This is my first AudioPod AI generated voice.');
    formData.append('audio_format', 'mp3');
    formData.append('speed', '1.0');
    
    const response = await fetch('https://api.audiopod.ai/api/v1/voice/voices/aura/generate', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.AUDIOPOD_API_KEY}`
      },
      body: formData
    });

    if (response.ok) {
      const jobData = await response.json();
      console.log(`Voice generation job created: ${jobData.id}`);
      console.log("Check job status to download audio when ready");
    }
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="cURL">
    ```bash
    curl -X POST "https://api.audiopod.ai/api/v1/voice/voices/aura/generate" \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
      -F "input_text=Hello world! This is my first AudioPod AI generated voice." \
      -F "audio_format=mp3" \
      -F "speed=1.0"
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="401 Unauthorized Error">
    This usually means your API key is invalid or missing. Make sure you're
    including the `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY` header in your requests.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Credit Limit Exceeded">
    Check your [AudioPod Account](https://www.audiopod.ai/dashboard/account) to
    see your credit balance and add more credits if needed.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Audio File Not Playing">
    Ensure you're saving the response as binary data. The audio is returned as
    raw bytes that need to be written to a file.
