## Step 3: Install SDK (Optional)

While you can use any HTTP client, we recommend using our official SDKs:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Python">```bash pip install audiopod-python ```</Tab>
  <Tab title="Node.js">```bash npm install audiopod-js ```</Tab>
  <Tab title="cURL">No installation required - use cURL directly</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 4: Make Your First API Call

Let's create your first AI-generated speech:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Python">
    ```python
    import os
    from audiopod import AudioPod

    # Initialize the client
    client = AudioPod(api_key=os.getenv("AUDIOPOD_API_KEY"))

    # Generate speech
    response = client.text_to_speech.create(
        text="Hello world! This is my first AudioPod AI generated voice.",
        voice_id="aura",  # Pre-built voice
        output_format="mp3"
    )

    # Save the audio file
    with open("hello_world.mp3", "wb") as f:
        f.write(response.audio_data)

    print("Audio generated successfully!")
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Node.js">
    ```javascript
    import { AudioPod } from 'audiopod-js';
    import fs from 'fs';

    // Initialize the client
    const client = new AudioPod({
      apiKey: process.env.AUDIOPOD_API_KEY
    });

    // Generate speech
    const response = await client.textToSpeech.create({
      text: "Hello world! This is my first AudioPod AI generated voice.",
      voiceId: "aura",  // Pre-built voice
      outputFormat: "mp3"
    });

    // Save the audio file
    fs.writeFileSync("hello_world.mp3", response.audioData);
    console.log("Audio generated successfully!");
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="cURL">
    ```bash
    curl -X POST "https://api.audiopod.ai/api/v1/text-to-speech" \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "text": "Hello world! This is my first AudioPod AI generated voice.",
        "voice_id": "aura",
        "output_format": "mp3"
      }' \
      --output hello_world.mp3
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 5: Understanding Credits

AudioPod AI uses a credit-based billing system:

- **Text-to-Speech**: ~1 credit per 1,000 characters
- **Speech-to-Text**: ~1 credit per minute of audio
- **Voice Cloning**: ~50 credits per voice model

## Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="401 Unauthorized Error">
    This usually means your API key is invalid or missing. Make sure you're
    including the `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY` header in your requests.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Credit Limit Exceeded">
    Check your [billing dashboard](https://www.audiopod.ai/dashboard/billing) to
    see your credit balance and add more credits if needed.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Audio File Not Playing">
    Ensure you're saving the response as binary data. The audio is returned as
    raw bytes that need to be written to a file.
  </Accordion>
