## How Credits Work

AudioPod AI uses a credit-based pricing model where different features consume credits based on usage. This provides transparent, predictable costs for your AI audio processing needs.

### Credit Basics

- **1 Credit = ~$0.000133 USD** (0.0133 cents)
- **7,500 credits = $1.00 USD** (Pay-as-you-go rate)
- Subscription credits reset monthly
- Pay-as-you-go credits never expire
- Volume discounts available

### Welcome Credits

New accounts receive **10,000 welcome credits** (~$1.33 value) to get started with AudioPod AI.

### Credit Types

AudioPod AI uses a dual credit system:

- **Subscription Credits**: Reset monthly based on your plan (Basic: 10,000, Starter: 40,000, etc.)
- **Pay-as-you-go Credits**: Purchase additional credits that never expire
- **Usage Priority**: Pay-as-you-go credits are used first, then subscription credits

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Python">
    ```python
    import requests

    def get_account_balance(api_key):
        headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}"}
        response = requests.get(
            "https://api.audiopod.ai/api/v1/credits",
            headers=headers
        )

        if response.status_code == 200:
            data = response.json()
            return {
                "balance": data["balance"],
                "payg_balance": data.get("payg_balance", 0),
                "total_available_credits": data["balance"] + data.get("payg_balance", 0)
            }

    balance = get_account_balance(your_api_key)
    print(f"Subscription credits: {balance['balance']}")
    print(f"Pay-as-you-go credits: {balance['payg_balance']}")
    print(f"Total available: {balance['total_available_credits']} credits")
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Node.js">
    ```javascript
    async function getAccountBalance(apiKey) {
        const response = await fetch('https://api.audiopod.ai/api/v1/credits', {
            headers: {
                'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}`
            }
        });
        
        if (response.ok) {
            const data = await response.json();
            return {
                balance: data.balance,
                paygBalance: data.payg_balance || 0,
                totalAvailable: data.balance + (data.payg_balance || 0)
            };
        }
        
        throw new Error('Failed to fetch balance');
    }
    
    const balance = await getAccountBalance(yourApiKey);
    console.log(`Subscription credits: ${balance.balance}`);
    console.log(`Pay-as-you-go credits: ${balance.paygBalance}`);
    console.log(`Total available: ${balance.totalAvailable} credits`);

## Cost Optimization

### Efficient Usage Tips

#### Text-to-Speech Optimization

```python
# Good: Process longer texts in single requests
long_text = "Your long content here..."
audio = client.tts.create(text=long_text)

# Avoid: Multiple small requests
# This uses more credits due to minimum charges
for sentence in sentences:
    audio = client.tts.create(text=sentence)  # Less efficient
```

#### Batch Processing

```python
# Process multiple files together
audio_files = ["file1.mp3", "file2.mp3", "file3.mp3"]
results = client.batch_process(
    files=audio_files,
    operation="speech_to_text"
)
```

#### Quality vs. Cost

- Use appropriate quality settings for your use case
- Consider compressed audio formats for storage
- Implement caching for repeated requests

### Usage Patterns

Monitor and optimize based on patterns:

- **Peak Usage Times**: Identify and plan for high-usage periods
- **Feature Utilization**: Focus resources on most-used features
- **Error Rates**: Reduce costs by fixing API usage errors
