  <Tab title="Python">
    ```python
    from audiopod import AudioPod

    client = AudioPod(api_key="your_api_key")

    # Transform voice in audio file
    with open("original_voice.mp3", "rb") as audio_file:
        response = client.voice_changer.transform(
            audio=audio_file,
            target_voice="deep_male",  # Preset transformation
            intensity=0.7,             # 0.0 to 1.0
            preserve_timing=True       # Keep original timing
        )

    # Save transformed audio
    with open("transformed_voice.mp3", "wb") as f:
        f.write(response.audio_data)

## Advanced Transformations

### Custom Voice Parameters

Fine-tune voice characteristics with precise control:

```python
response = client.voice_changer.transform(
    audio=audio_file,
    # Pitch control
    pitch_shift=0.8,           # 0.5-2.0 (0.5=octave down, 2.0=octave up)
    pitch_variation=0.1,       # Natural pitch variation
    
    # Timbre modification  
    formant_shift=1.2,         # Voice texture/resonance
    spectral_tilt=0.9,         # Brightness/darkness
    
    # Speaking characteristics
    speaking_rate=0.9,         # 0.5-2.0 (slower/faster)
    energy_level=1.1,          # Volume and intensity
    
    # Voice quality
    breathiness=0.2,           # Add breathy quality
    roughness=0.1,             # Add vocal roughness
    tenseness=0.3,             # Vocal tension
    
    # Emotional expression
    emotion="confident",
    emotion_intensity=0.6,
    
    # Technical settings
    preserve_timing=True,      # Keep original timing
    noise_reduction=True,      # Clean up artifacts
    quality="high"             # standard, high, premium
)
```

### Real-time Voice Changing

For live applications like streaming or gaming:

```python
# Initialize real-time voice changer
stream = client.voice_changer.create_stream(
    target_voice="deep_male",
    latency="low",          # low, medium, high (quality vs speed)
    buffer_size=1024,       # Audio buffer size
    sample_rate=44100
)

# Process audio chunks in real-time
def process_audio_chunk(chunk):
    transformed_chunk = stream.process(chunk)
    return transformed_chunk

# Start streaming
while streaming:
    audio_chunk = get_microphone_input()
    transformed_audio = process_audio_chunk(audio_chunk)
    play_audio_output(transformed_audio)

# Clean up
stream.close()
```

### Voice Morphing Between Speakers

Blend characteristics from multiple voices:

```python
# Morph between two voices
with open("voice_a.mp3", "rb") as voice_a, open("voice_b.mp3", "rb") as voice_b:
    morphed_voice = client.voice_changer.morph_voices(
        source_voice=voice_a,
        target_voice=voice_b,
        morph_ratio=0.6,        # 0.0=source, 1.0=target, 0.5=blend
        preserve_content=True,   # Keep original words
        smooth_transition=True   # Gradual morphing
    )
```

### Real-time Streaming

For continuous streaming applications:
- **Per-minute billing** based on actual processing time
- **Bulk discounts** for heavy usage
- **Enterprise plans** with flat-rate pricing available

## Best Practices

### Audio Quality Guidelines

**✅ Recommended:**
- High-quality source audio (44.1kHz or higher)
- Clear speech with minimal background noise
- Consistent volume levels
- Single speaker recordings

**❌ Avoid:**
- Low-quality, compressed audio
- Multiple overlapping speakers
- Heavy background noise or music
- Extremely quiet or loud recordings

### Transformation Guidelines

```python
# Good: Gradual transformations for natural results
natural_transform = {
    "pitch_shift": 1.1,        # Subtle pitch change
    "intensity": 0.6,          # Moderate intensity
    "preserve_timing": True    # Keep natural rhythm
}

# Avoid: Extreme transformations that sound unnatural
extreme_transform = {
    "pitch_shift": 2.5,        # Too extreme
    "intensity": 1.0,          # Maximum intensity
    "multiple_effects": True    # Too many effects
}
```

### Performance Optimization

```python
# Batch processing for multiple files
files_to_process = ["audio1.mp3", "audio2.mp3", "audio3.mp3"]

batch_job = client.voice_changer.batch_transform(
    files=files_to_process,
    target_voice="professional_male",
    parallel_processing=True,    # Process multiple files simultaneously
    priority="normal"            # normal, high, urgent
)

# Monitor batch progress
status = client.voice_changer.get_batch_status(batch_job.id)
```

### Error Handling Code

```python
def robust_voice_transformation(audio_file, target_voice, max_retries=3):
    """Transform voice with error handling and retry logic"""
    
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            with open(audio_file, "rb") as audio:
                response = client.voice_changer.transform(
                    audio=audio,
                    target_voice=target_voice,
                    quality="high",
                    preserve_timing=True
                )
                
                return response.audio_data
                
        except AudioPodError as e:
            if e.status_code == 400:
                # Bad request - check parameters
                print(f"Invalid parameters: {e.message}")
                break
            elif e.status_code == 429:
                # Rate limit - wait and retry
                wait_time = (2 ** attempt) * 30
                print(f"Rate limited. Waiting {wait_time}s...")
                time.sleep(wait_time)
            elif e.status_code >= 500:
                # Server error - retry
                print(f"Server error (attempt {attempt + 1}): {e.message}")
                time.sleep(30)
