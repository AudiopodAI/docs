## Overview

AudioPod AI's Text to Speech service provides unified text-to-speech capabilities for both **standard pre-built voices** and **custom voice clones**. Using state of the art Text to Speech Models, generate speech with any voice in 60+ supported languages.

### Supported Voice Types

- **Standard Voices**: Pre-built professional voices 
- **Custom Voices**: Your own voice clones created via [Voice Management](/api-reference/voice-management)
- **Unified API**: Same endpoint works for both voice types seamlessly

### Key Features

- **50+ Premium Voices**: Pre-built voices with unique characteristics
- **Custom Voice Support**: Use your own voice clones and collections
- **Variable Speed Control**: Adjust speech speed from 0.25x to 4.0x
- **Multiple Formats**: MP3, WAV, OGG and provider-specific formats
- **Real-time Generation**: Background job processing with status tracking

## Authentication

All endpoints require authentication using either:
- **API Key**: `Authorization: Bearer your_api_key`
- **JWT Token**: `Authorization: Bearer your_jwt_token`

## Generate Speech

    )

    filename = f"welcome_{item['lang']}.mp3"
    with open(filename, "wb") as f:
        f.write(response.audio_data)
```

## Use Cases & Examples

### Audiobook Narration

```python
def create_audiobook_chapter(chapter_text, narrator_voice="sage"):
    # Split long text into manageable chunks
    chunks = split_text_by_sentences(chapter_text, max_length=2000)
    audio_segments = []

    for i, chunk in enumerate(chunks):
        print(f"Processing chunk {i+1}/{len(chunks)}")

        response = client.text_to_speech.create(
            text=chunk,
            voice_id=narrator_voice,
            quality="premium",
            speed=0.95  # Slightly slower for audiobooks
        )

        audio_segments.append(response.audio_data)

    # Combine audio segments
    return combine_audio_segments(audio_segments)
```

### Podcast Introduction

```python
intro_script = '''
<speak>
    <p><emphasis level="strong">Welcome back to the Tech Talk Podcast!</emphasis></p>
    <break time="1s"/>
    <p>I'm your host, and today we're diving deep into
    <emphasis>artificial intelligence</emphasis> and its impact on content creation.</p>
    <break time="0.5s"/>
    <p>Let's get started!</p>
</speak>
'''

intro_audio = client.text_to_speech.create(
    text=intro_script,
    voice_id="ava",
    text_format="ssml",
    emotion="professional",
    quality="high"
)
```

### E-Learning Content

```python
def create_lesson_audio(lesson_content):
    # Add natural pauses for learning
    formatted_content = f'''
    <speak>
        <p>Lesson begins now.</p>
        <break time="1s"/>
        {lesson_content}
        <break time="2s"/>
        <p>That concludes this lesson. Take a moment to review what you've learned.</p>
    </speak>
    '''

    return client.text_to_speech.create(
        text=formatted_content,
        voice_id="sage",  # Educational voice
        text_format="ssml",
        speed=0.9,  # Slower for learning
        quality="high"
    )
```

### Interactive Voice Response (IVR)

```python
ivr_prompts = {
    "welcome": "Thank you for calling AudioPod AI. Your call is important to us.",
    "menu": "Press 1 for sales, 2 for support, or 3 for billing.",
    "hold": "Please hold while we connect you to the next available agent."
}

for prompt_name, text in ivr_prompts.items():
    audio = client.text_to_speech.create(
        text=text,
        voice_id="ava",  # Professional voice for business
        quality="standard",  # Lower quality for phone systems
        sample_rate=8000,   # Phone quality
        output_format="wav"
    )

    with open(f"ivr_{prompt_name}.wav", "wb") as f:
        f.write(audio.audio_data)
```

## Best Practices

### Text Optimization

**✅ Good Practices:**

- Use proper punctuation for natural pauses
- Write numbers in word form for better pronunciation
- Include context for abbreviations
- Break long sentences into shorter ones

**❌ Common Issues:**

- ALL CAPS TEXT (sounds like shouting)
- Missing punctuation (unnatural flow)
- Technical jargon without context
- Extremely long paragraphs

### Cost Optimization

```python
# Efficient: Single request for multiple sentences
long_text = "First sentence. Second sentence. Third sentence."
audio = client.text_to_speech.create(text=long_text, voice_id="aura")

# Inefficient: Multiple requests for short texts
# This uses more credits due to minimum charges
for sentence in sentences:
    audio = client.text_to_speech.create(text=sentence, voice_id="aura")
```

### Caching Strategy

```python
import hashlib
import os

def get_cached_audio(text, voice_id, cache_dir="audio_cache"):
    # Create cache key from text and voice
    cache_key = hashlib.md5(f"{text}_{voice_id}".encode()).hexdigest()
    cache_file = os.path.join(cache_dir, f"{cache_key}.mp3")

    if os.path.exists(cache_file):
        with open(cache_file, "rb") as f:
            return f.read()

    # Generate new audio
    response = client.text_to_speech.create(
        text=text,
        voice_id=voice_id
    )

    # Cache the result
    os.makedirs(cache_dir, exist_ok=True)
    with open(cache_file, "wb") as f:
        f.write(response.audio_data)

    return response.audio_data
```

## Error Handling

### Common Errors and Solutions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="400 Bad Request - Invalid Text">
    **Causes:** - Text too long (>5000 characters) - Invalid characters or
    encoding - Empty text field **Solutions:** - Split long text into chunks -
    Check text encoding (UTF-8) - Validate text is not empty
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="400 Bad Request - Invalid Voice">
    **Causes:** - Voice ID doesn't exist - Voice not available for selected
    language **Solutions:** - Check available voices with `/voices` endpoint -
    Use multi-language voices for multiple languages
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="429 Too Many Requests">
    **Causes:** - Rate limit exceeded - Too many concurrent requests
    **Solutions:** - Implement exponential backoff - Use request queuing -
    Upgrade to higher rate limits
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Robust Error Handling

```python
import time
import random

def generate_speech_with_retry(text, voice_id, max_retries=3):
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            response = client.text_to_speech.create(
                text=text,
                voice_id=voice_id
            )
            return response.audio_data

        except Exception as e:
            if e.status_code == 429:  # Rate limit
                # Exponential backoff with jitter
                delay = (2 ** attempt) + random.uniform(0, 1)
                time.sleep(delay)
                continue
            elif e.status_code == 400:
                # Bad request - don't retry
                raise e
            else:
                # Other errors - retry with delay
                time.sleep(1)
                continue

    raise Exception("Max retries exceeded")
```

## Pricing

Text to Speech pricing is based on audio duration:

- **330 credits per minute** of generated audio
- Pricing is calculated on the actual audio output duration
- All voice types (standard and custom) use the same rate
- Quality settings don't affect pricing

### Cost Examples

| Audio Duration | Credits Used | USD Cost |
| -------------- | ------------ | -------- |
| 30 seconds     | 165 credits  | $0.022   |
| 1 minute       | 330 credits  | $0.044   |
| 2 minutes      | 660 credits  | $0.088   |
| 5 minutes      | 1,650 credits| $0.220   |
