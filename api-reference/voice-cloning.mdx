## Overview

AudioPod AI's Voice Cloning API allows you to create custom voice models from audio samples and generate speech using those personalized voices. Train high-quality voice models with just 10 seconds of clean audio.

### Key Features

- **Quick Training**: Create voice models from 10+ seconds of audio
- **Multi-Sample Support**: Upload up to 5 audio samples for better quality
- **Real-time Generation**: Generate speech with custom voices instantly
- **Multiple Languages**: Support for 50+ languages
- **Voice Collections**: Organize and manage voice models
- **Preview Generation**: Test voices before using them in production

## Authentication

All voice cloning endpoints require authentication using either:
- **API Key**: `Authorization: Bearer your_api_key`
- **JWT Token**: `Authorization: Bearer your_jwt_token`

## Best Practices

### Audio Quality Requirements

For best voice cloning results:

- **Duration**: 10-60 seconds of clean audio
- **Format**: WAV, MP3, or M4A
- **Sample Rate**: 22kHz or higher
- **Quality**: Clear speech without background noise
- **Content**: Natural speech with varied intonation

### Training Tips

```python
# Good training audio characteristics
training_requirements = {
    "duration": "10-60 seconds",
    "background_noise": "minimal",
    "speech_style": "natural and conversational",
    "emotions": "varied but not extreme",
    "volume": "consistent throughout",
    "breathing": "natural pauses included"
}

# Multiple samples for better quality
sample_types = [
    "conversational_speech.wav",  # Natural conversation
    "reading_aloud.wav",         # Clear articulation
    "emotional_speech.wav"       # Some emotional variation
]
```

### Cost Optimization

- **Voice Model Training**: 500 credits per voice model
- **Speech Generation**: 5 credits per minute of generated audio
- **Voice Conversion**: 8 credits per minute of source audio

## Error Handling

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="400 Bad Request - Invalid Audio">
    **Causes:** - Audio file too short (<10 seconds) - Unsupported audio format - 
    Corrupted audio file **Solutions:** - Use WAV/MP3 files with clear speech - 
    Ensure minimum 10 seconds duration - Check audio file integrity
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="402 Payment Required - Insufficient Credits">
    **Causes:** - Not enough credits for voice training - Account credit limit exceeded
    **Solutions:** - Purchase additional credits - Check credit balance before training
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="404 Not Found - Voice Model Missing">
    **Causes:** - Voice ID doesn't exist - Voice model was deleted - Access denied to voice
    **Solutions:** - Verify voice ID is correct - Check if voice model is still active
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Pricing

Voice cloning costs are based on training and generation:

| Operation | Cost | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| Voice Model Training | 500 credits | Per voice model created |
| Speech Generation | 5 credits/minute | Generated audio duration |
| Voice Conversion | 8 credits/minute | Source audio duration |
| Multi-Voice Generation | 7 credits/minute | Combined output duration |
